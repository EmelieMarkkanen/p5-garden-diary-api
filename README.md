# Project

## API owner goal

# Technology

## Languages

## Framework

# Project management

# Testing

## Automated tests

## Manual testing
Manual testing was done through the Django Rest Framework admin backend throughout development. Manual testing have also been done through the [Garden diary frontend website](https://garden-diary.herokuapp.com/), by sending and fetching data from the API throughout development.

## PEP8 python linter
I used the [Code Institute Python linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) to test all [Garden diary API python code](assets/Printscreens). Some errors with too long lines and trailing whitespaces were corrected.
